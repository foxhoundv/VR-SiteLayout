# VRSiteLayout

Simple Description
==================
Layout for grids that allow user to view regular site and with a VR device turns site into VR.

Goal
====
Create a standard for CSS and JS to allow any site that uses bootsrap concepts, to utilize same standards and add to them.  Therefore creating a basic larger viewsize or viewmode that will be picked up by the browser and re-interpret the site into a dual view for VR availability.  This can be done by a few ways: 1) Google Cardboard - Allow for Google Cardboard logo that is selectable and changes  2) Through proprietary VR Devices( that another current project can utilize: https://github.com/foxhoundv/VR-SiteBrowser), based on the software being used, ie, Samsung Internet on the Samsung GearVR.
